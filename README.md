# RL-Algorithms-for-iBMI-Applications

RL-Algorithms-for-iBMI-Applications is a code repository that contains various algorithms that facilitates the application of five popular online RL Algorithms (Banditron, Banditron-RP, Deep Q-Learning, AGREL, and HRL) in the context of intention decoders for iBMI systems. 

## About this repo: 
This repo hosts the MATLAB source codes that directly acts on in-house recorded dataset (a small portion of it is [publicly available](https://osf.io/dce96/))
